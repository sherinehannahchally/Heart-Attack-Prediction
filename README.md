# Heart-Attack-Prediction

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).

Analyze numerical and categorical variables within the scope of univariate analysis by using Distplot and Pie Chart graphics.

Within the scope of bivariate analysis, analyze the variables among each other using FacetGrid, Count Plot, Pair Plot, Swarm plot, Box plot, and Heatmap graphics.

Make the data set ready for the model. In this context, we struggled with missing and outlier values.

Use four different algorithms in the model phase.
